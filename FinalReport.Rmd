# Introduction
Yelp has been collecting the users' review for the businesses from the major cities at North America and Europe since October 2004. This data set *business* collects the information from `r dim(yelp_business)[1]` businesses across 10 cities. Data set *checkin* stores `r dim(yelp_checkin)[1]` durations and frequencies a user stay in every business. Data set *review* sumarizes `r dim(yelp_review)[1]` reviews for a registed business. Data set *tip* summarizes the `r dim(yelp_tip)[1]` recommendations for a business. Data set *user* collects the information from  `r dim(yelp_user)[1]` registed users.  

[Yelp's recommandation engine][1] has been designed to filter the active and available review articles for a business. A couple of attributes were summarized from the data accumulated in the past decade. The data set *business* has `r dim(yelp_business$attributes)[2]` variables in which `r length( sapply(yelp_business$attributes, is.data.frame)[sapply(yelp_business$attributes, is.data.frame) %in% TRUE] )` variables are data frame. If these variables constituent the evaluation model how yelp users evaluate a local businesses, will we figure, for a category of business, a global standard across cities or many local standards in each city?  In use of [Bayesian network][2], we set up the criterion to answer this question. When the Bayesian network showed that the city is not the child node of any variable, there is no a unified model for all the businesses of a category across cities. Ohterwise, there is a unified model to tell people how to evaluate a kind of business based on yelp stars or a specific attribute.
