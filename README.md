## Bayesian Networks/Probabilistic expert systems
Retrieved from (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/gR.html)

[catnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/catnet/index.html) A package that handles discrete Bayesian network models and provides inference using the frequentist approach
[lcd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lcd/index.html) Learn Chain graphs via Decomposition. Functions for learning chain graphs (and as a special case, Bayesian networks) via the decomposition approach.
[abn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abn/index.html) A graphical modelling formulation is used to construct Bayesian regression models for analyses of multivariate data.
[bnlearn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnlearn/index.html) Bayesian network structure learning via constraint-based (also known as 'conditional independence') and score-based algorithms. This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS) algorithm, the Incremental Association (IAMB) algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB) algorithm, the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC) algorithm and the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian networks, along with many score functions and conditional independence tests. Some utility functions (model comparison and manipulation, random data generation, arc orientation testing) are also included.
[deal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deal/index.html) Learning Bayesian networks with mixed (discrete and continuous) variables.
[gRain](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gRain/index.html) A package for probability propagation in graphical independence networks, also known as probabilistic expert systems (which includes Bayesian networks as a special case). [Link:](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i10/)
[RHugin](http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rhugin/) The Hugin Decision Engine (HDE) is commercial software produced by HUGIN EXPERT A/S for building and making inference from Bayesian belief networks. The RHugin package provides a suite of functions allowing the HDE to be controlled from within the R environment for statistical computing. The RHugin package can thus be used to build Bayesian belief networks, enter and propagate evidence, and to retrieve beliefs. Additionally, the RHugin package can read and write hkb and NET files, making it easy to work simultaneously with both the RHugin package and the Hugin GUI. A licensed copy of the HDE (or the trial version) is required for the RHugin package to function, hence the target audience for the package is Hugin users who would like to take advantage of the statistical and programatic capabilities of R. Notice: RHugin is NOT on CRAN. [Link:](http://rhugin.r-forge.r-project.org/)
