## Question and Hypothesis

- Will we figure, for a category of business, a global standard across cities or many local standards in each city? 
- If there is a global evluation model for a kind of business, the stars should be the last considered variable after considered the other atrributes.  
- We fcosued on fast foods and Chinese restaurants.  

## Method: Baysian Network

- Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that illustrates a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- In our explorary analysis, we used hill-climbing(HC) to illustrate the relations among variables and attributes for fast foods and Chinese restaurants.
- We build the local evaulation models for fast foods and Chinese restaurants in Phoenix and Charlotte. The method to build the final evaluation models is adapted from [Multiple Quantitative Trait Analysis Using Bayesian Networks](http://www.bnlearn.com/research/genetics14/).

## Every city has a evaluation model

- Yelp stars is the final criterion for the businesses that have managed the chained stores across many cities. For many local businesses, there are a set of local attributes have to be identified.
- Every category of business get the final recommendation through considering a series of attribues.
- More implications for the customers, business owners, and Yelp software engineers are discussed.
